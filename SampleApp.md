## Sample application: RoBlog ##

RoBlog is a simple blogging application using Ronin and RoninDB. If you'd like to see these systems in action, and see how they integrate together for an easy, low-configuration, type-safe application development framework, you can [download RoBlog](http://code.google.com/p/ronin-gosu/downloads/list). It's written entirely in Gosu, so you can inspect the source to see how it works with Ronin and RoninDB; its source is also included in [Ronin's source repository](http://code.google.com/p/ronin-gosu/source/checkout). In order to run it, you'll need to download the required files for [Ronin](Ronin#Getting_started.md) and [RoninDB](RoninDB#Getting_started.md). (RoBlog uses H2 and Jetty.) By default, the "admin" user's password is "password".
