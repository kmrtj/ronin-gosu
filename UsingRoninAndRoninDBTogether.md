## Using Ronin and RoninDB together ##

As you may have noticed, each RoninDB entity type defines `fromID()` and `toID()` methods, which means that they are also valid Ronin entity types. Using RoninDB entities in a Ronin app therefore requires no extra effort on your part. For example, if you have a RoninDB type called `db.mydb.Person`, you can define a Ronin controller like:

```
package controller
uses db.mydb.Person
class PersonController {
  static function view(p : Person) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Accessing the URL "`http://localhost:8080/PersonController/view?p=5`" will automatically fetch the `Person` object whose ID is 5 from the database and pass it to your `view()` method.

The RoninDB transaction model is thread-local, so it is safe to use within a Ronin request, since most web servers run each request in its own thread.
