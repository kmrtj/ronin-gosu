## Transactions ##

Sometimes you want to make a set of changes to your database all at once; if one of the changes fails for some reason, you don't want the rest to go through. Consider this code:

```
var myAccount = Account.fromID(5)
var theirAccount = Account.fromID(7)
myAccount.Balance -= 5000
theirAccount.Balance += 5000
myAccount.update()
theirAccount.update()
```

If the first update succeeds, but the second update fails, $5000 has just disappeared.

Fortunately, RoninDB provides basic transaction semantics to avoid such a dilemma:

```
var myAccount = Account.fromID(5)
var theirAccount = Account.fromID(7)
myAccount.Balance -= 5000
theirAccount.Balance += 5000
using(db.mydb.Transaction.Lock) {
 myAccount.update()
 theirAccount.update()
}
```

`Transaction` is a type that is automatically created in each package corresponding to a .dbc file. Changes to the database made during the `using` block only take effect once execution has successfully reached the end of the block. If the second update fails (or some other code you place between the two updates throws an uncaught exception), the first one will not take effect.
