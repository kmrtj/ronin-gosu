## Foreign keys and join tables ##

RoninDB will generate links and collection properties between entity objects, assuming you've set up your foreign keys and/or join tables according to the schema guidelines.

For example, say you have tables "`Person`" and "`Company`", and Gosu variables "`p`" and "`c`" containing a `Person` and a `Company`. If the table "`Person`" has a FK named "`Employer_Company_id`", then `p.Employer` will fetch and return the `Company` object which the FK points to (or `null` if the FK is null), and `c.Persons` will return a `List` of all the `Person` objects whose FK points to that `Company`. (If the FK column was named simply "`Company_id`", then the property on `Person` would be `p.Company`.)

If instead you have a join table named "`Employment_join_Company_Person`" (so that a `Person` could have multiple employers), `p.Employment` would return the `Companies` linked to that `Person` through the join table, and `c.Employment` would do likewise for a `Company`. If the join table was named "`join_Company_Person`", the properties would be `c.Persons` and `p.Companys`. (RoninDB does not attempt to be grammatically correct with its generated property names.) For a self-join table, such as "`Relatives_join_Person_Person`", the generated property would be `p.Relatives` for both sides.

## Modifying FKs and join tables ##

The `List` objects returned by join table properties can be modified in order to update the join table. For example:

```
var bob = Person.fromID(5)
var fred = Person.fromID(7)
bob.Relatives.add(fred)
```

will create an entry in the "`Relatives_join_Person_Person`" table linking Bob to Fred.

This is not true of FK relationships. The `List` returned by `c.Persons` in the first example above does not persist any changes to the database. Instead, modifications should be made to the foreign key itself. To add a `Person` to a `Company`:

```
p.Company = c
```

and to remove it:

```
p.Company = null
```

Finally, let's look at [transactions in RoninDB](Transactions.md).
