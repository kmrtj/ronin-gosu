## Schema guidelines ##

RoninDB follows the principle of [convention over configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration). It expects your database schema to adhere to the following guidelines.

  * **Entity tables** are tables which will be represented as types in Gosu. An entity table must have a single primary key column called "`id`". (Note that "id" must be lowercase. If you're using H2, you'll need to put quotes around the column name, or else it will capitalize it automatically.)
  * **Foreign keys** from one entity table to another can either be named "`[target table]_id`" or "`[name]_[target table]_id`", where "name" is the name you'd like Gosu to use for the foreign key.
  * **Join tables** can either be named "`join_[first table]_[second table]`" or "`[name]_join_[first table]_[second table]`", where "name" is the name you'd like Gosu to use for the join property. The join table must have columns named "`[first table]_id`" and "`[second table]_id`". If the two sides of the join are the same table, the columns must instead be named "`[table name]_src_id`" and "`[table name]_dest_id`".
